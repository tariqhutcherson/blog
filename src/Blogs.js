        content: `When you hear the word “worship”, what’s the first thing that comes to your mind? For some, it may be the segment that typically happens in the beginning of a church service before the preacher gets up there. You’re giving God praise through your singing, dancing, crying, praying, etc. For others, it may be the building of statues and pyramids. Creating pieces or altars that you can bow down to. There’s a long list of things that exist, depending on who you ask. Worship can include all of those things, and more.

Worship, by definition, is the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a deity. The interesting thing about this, is you can make anything a deity. There’s thousands of religions and ways of life that surround different ideas of how life should be lived. These different gods are sometimes depicted as supernatural beings with no form or shape. A lot of them are seen as resembling mankind, animals, or even both. The Bible even alludes to money as a figure of worship because many people orchestrate their lives based on it. Their need of it for joy, validation, and fulfillment. 

We all have an inner desire to be purposeful. As a matter of fact, questions that we ask ourselves all the time are “what is my purpose” or “what’s the purpose of this”. This search for purpose leads us to worship.

Your lifestyle is a reflection of what or whom you worship. A lot of times, we may not even recognize it because we build habits over time. The pain from our past will submit an opinion, too. One that happens often is that people worship other people’s opinions. They aren’t happy, affirmed, or satisfied until they have the approval of certain people. 

So, when you think of worship, think of all of the above. Your thoughts, your words, and your behavior are an expression of your worship. You worship Monday through Saturday… just like on Sunday… or whatever applies to your current schedule. And for the sake of living the life that you’re created to live, work towards having all of those aligned with the heart and mind of the True and Living God. `,

        content: `Grief.

Grief, a feeling that many experience, but don’t understand. 

I understand why many people don’t investigate grief. Very few people I’ve ever come across enjoy that type of pain. I would’ve said nobody, but some people do enjoy that type of pain, but I digress. Learning about grief requires that you face it head on when it’s easier short term to ignore or avoid it.

Grief, a feeling that varies in strength depending on the person.

Some people may not care that their pet dies, while others need to take time off for it. This person may have lost a friend and it affects them a little while that person lost a coworker and it affects them a lot. 

Grief, a feeling that doesn’t necessarily have a time table to it.

You could take two people who lost the same and loved equally, but one only needed a month to mourn while the other needed a year. Your anguish could be intense for a few weeks, light for the next month, then back to intense for a day, causing you to think you relapsed and wonder when it’ll end.

With all of that considered…

Grief, I’ll argue, is a good sign. It’s a sign that you loved what you lost. It’s a sign that you’re in tune to your emotions. It’s a sign that you’re able to sympathize with others when the loss wasn’t yours. 

It’s rarely fun to hear that suffering comes with the good. Especially if you’re in the middle of it. However, it’s powerful when you learn that delaying the grieving process makes things worse. What you’re feeling inside will come out, it’s just a matter of how it comes out. 

People who are unstable and lash out randomly are often people who didn’t grieve properly. People who mistreat others and are indifferent to evil are often people who didn’t grieve properly. People who hate the world and have damaging habits are often people who didn’t grieve properly.

Just like anything positive, it can become negative if not managed right. Fortunately, the God of the universe, the One whom made us with intention and care, is here to walk with us every step of the way. There’s a time to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. He’ll give you the strength to do it all.

Don’t be afraid to understand your grief. 

Don’t condemn yourself for how strong your grief is.

Don’t become discouraged by how long your grief lasts.

The grieving heart is a healthy heart. The grieving heart is a selfless heart. The grieving heart is a thriving heart. It’s better to have a grieving heart.`,
